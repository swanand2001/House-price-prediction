**What is Machine Learning?**__


“Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.”


**Techniques used for modelling**

1)Linear Regression-Linear regression is useful for finding relationship between two continuous variables. One is predictor or independent variable and other is response or dependent variable. It looks for statistical relationship but not deterministic relationship. Relationship between two variables is said to be deterministic if one variable can be accurately expressed by the other.

2)Random Forest Regression-A Random Forest is an ensemble technique capable of performing both regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap and Aggregation, commonly known as bagging. The basic idea behind this is to combine multiple decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on individual decision trees.

**Prerequisites:**
A system running Windows 10
Anaconda Navigator
Command Prompt


####Install Anaconda Navigator:
1)Download Anaconda. We recommend downloading Anaconda's latest Python 3 version (currently Python 3.5).
2)Install the version of Anaconda which you downloaded, following the instructions on https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/
3)Import the necessary libraries from the command prompt if required


###Running the project
1)Open Command Prompt
2)Clone the repository:
3)Open Anaconda Navigator
4)Open Jupyter Notebook
5)Open the cloned folder in the jupyter notebook
6)Run each cell of the rdbms-ia2.ipynb file



**Conclusion**:On testing the regression model, the test score for forest regression was better as comapred to linear regression.
